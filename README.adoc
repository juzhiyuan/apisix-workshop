Welcome to this workshop on https://apisix.apache.org/[Apache APISIX^]!

In this session, we will to show a couple of APISIX's nifty features that can help your information system cope with the challenges introduced by APIs:

* Routing your calls to an `Upstream`
* Available abstractions: `Route`, `Upstream`, `Consumer`, and `Plugin`
* The Apache APISIX dashboard
* Configuring APISIX with the dashboard
* Configuring APISIX with the command-line
* Monitoring APISIX
* Introduction to plugin development in Lua

The workshop is designed to be self-driven, but if at any point, you need help, just ask the instructor for help.

== Overview

This section explains the context of the workshop.
If you prefer, you can directly skip to the link:#prerequisites[hands-on part].

https://apisix.apache.org/[Apache APISIX^] is an _API Gateway_ steered by the https://apache.org/[Apache Foundation^].

When you expose your services to the outside world, a lot of bad things can happen.
For instance, a malicious actor could try to access your services without permission.
Or they could try to access your services with invalid data.
Or they could try to overload your services with too many requests.

You need to protect your services.
However, it doesn't make any sense to let each developer team handle these requirements on each service.
The age-old solution is to hide your services behind a _reverse proxy_:
the reverse proxy is the single point of entry to your information system and protects your services.
https://www.nginx.com/[nginx^] is a solid and mature reverse-proxy.

Because they were designed before APIs, reverse proxies have a big issue:
they don't differentiate between clients.
For example, to protect agains +++<abbr title="Distributed Denial of Service">DDoS</abbr>+++ attacks, they can limit the number of requests for all clients.
Some may even allow to configure different limits for different IP addresses (or ranges).
However, API providers probably offer different quotas at different prices.
A single customer may want to subscribe to two different offers, for two different departments with different requirements - and different budgets.

That's where API Gateways enter the field.
An API Gateway is a reverse proxy "on steroids".
It should do everything a reverse proxy does, and more, especially in the context of APIs.

== Laying out the workshop

* This workshops is based on Docker Compose.
You need a way to run https://www.docker.com/[Docker^] and Docker Compose files.
Docker Dashboard works.
If you want to use something else, please feel free to do so but if something doesn't work because of it, know that it decreases your chances that the instructor probably can help you with it.
* We use the https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html[curl^] command for API testing.
You can also use other tools such as Postman for testing.

The workshop is hosted on a https://github.com/nfrankel/apisix-workshop/[GitHub repository^].
At the root of the repository is a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines the infrastructure.

Clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/nfrankel/apisix-workshop.git
----

Switch the current directory to the `apisix-workshop` path.

[source,bash]
----
cd apisix-workshop
----

Run the `docker compose` command to start the infrastructure:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

Once everything is started, we can run a simple `curl` command to check if APISIX is running.

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:9180/apisix/admin/routes -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1'
----

Don't worry about the command for now.
It should return something similar to:

[source,json]
----
{"list":[],"total":0}
----

== First steps

In this section, we will create the most basic object in APISIX, the `Route`.
When Apache APISIX receives a request matching the `Route` parameters, it forwards it to the configured service.

=== Dynamic configuration vs. static configuration

[NOTE]
====
In the context of APISIX, configuration can mean two things:
configuration of APISIX itself or configuration of its routing rules.
The workshop has taken care of the former, so you can learn about the latter.
====

Apache APISIX offers two configuration models.
By default, it uses a dynamic one:
to configure routing rules, you send HTTP requests to the _Admin API_.
Another option is to use static configuration based on a YAML file.
It's the way for GitOps-based organizations.

In this workshop, we will focus on dynamic configuration, _i.e._, HTTP calls.

=== Our first `Route`

In this section, we will create our first `Route`.
The Docker Compose file defines an `httpbin` service so you don't need Internet access.
The goal is to create a `Route` that forwards requests to the `httpbin` service, in particular:

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:9080/anything
----

Read the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/getting-started/configure-routes/[documentation^] and create the `Route` for the above requirement.

If you cannot proceed further or when you are finished, reveal the hint:

.See the solution
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/1_create_route.sh[]
----

<1> The `/apisix/admin/routes` endpoint manages `Route` objects.
<2> Because configuration is a highly critical feature, we need to authenticate via an API key.
Here, we use the default one.
It's highly advised to generate your own, and regularly change it.
<3> APISIX can match on several parameters:
host, HTTP method(s), path, and client IP addresses.
Only the path is required.
If methods are not specified, it matches all methods.
<4> Notice the star character:
every URI starting with `/anything/` matches the `Route`.
<5> `Upstream` defined embedded in the `Route`.
An `Upstream` references a cluster of nodes, which you can load balance across, depending on an algorithm.
The default algorithm is _round robbin_.
Here, we have a single `Upstream`.
====

At this point, we can check whether the configuration works:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:9080/anything
----

Astute readers might have noticed that the Admin API runs on port `9180` while the Gateway operates on port `9080`.
It allows to expose the latter to the outside world while keeping the former private for security reasons.

=== Create an `Upstream`

In the previous section, we created a `Route` with an embedded `Upstream`.
The problem with this approach is that you need to define the same `Upstream` in all the `Route` objects that use it.
APISIX offers a better way to manage this: the `Upstream` object.
We can create an `Upstream` once and reference it throughout multiple `Route` objects.

The Apache APISIX API is consistent:
the API for `Upstream` is similar to the API for `Route`.
With the help of the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/admin-api/#upstream-api[documentation^] and the command used to create the Route above, create an `Upstream` with the following properties:

* ID: `1`
* Single node
* The node points to `httpbin:80`

.See the solution
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/2_create_upstream.sh[]
----
====

You can configure the `Upstream` with additional properties like health check, retries, retry timeout or load-balancing to multiple systems.

=== Bind the `Route` to the `Upstream`

In the previous section, we created an `Upstream` that referenced our backend service.
It can be referenced by `upstream_id` in a `Route`.
Create a new `Route` that references it with the help of the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/admin-api/#route-api[documentation^].

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/3_bind_route_to_upstream.sh[]
----

<1> We use the same id `1` as above, so we are replacing the previous `Route` with this one
<2> Match the `/anything*` path as before
<3> Forwards to the `Upstream` defined above
====

Let's test:

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:9080/anything/goes
----

It should return the expected data from the configured `Upstream`.

`Upstream` objects are a powerful abstraction in Apache APISIX.
They allow to define a single object across multiple `Route` objects so that there is only a single `Upstream` that needs to be maintained.

== The APISIX Dashboard

Along with the Admin API, Apache APISIX offers a Dashboard.
The https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard[Apache APISIX Dashboard^] is designed to make it as easy as possible for users to configure Apache APISIX via a +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++.
You can find more information about the APISIX Dashboard in the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/dashboard/USER_GUIDE[user guide^].

If you have time, the Getting started with Apache APISIX Dashboard video tutorial is a good introduction to the dashboard:

[.text-center]
video::-9-HZKK2ccI[youtube,width=840,height=470]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The dashboard execute HTTP API calls under the cover.
You can verify this claim by interacting with the dashboard with your favorite's browser tools enabled.
Hence, whatever we do with the dashboard, we can do with the Admin API.

The reverse is not true:
the dashboard doesn't cover every possible API call.
====

Remember that though the backend service could implement it, it's more efficient to factor this feature in the API Gateway than to implement it in every service.
For this reason, we are going to add authentication to the Route.

=== Display the existing objects

So far, we created a `Route` and an `Upstream` via the +++<abbr title="Command-Line Interface">CLI </abbr>+++.
We can see the result of our work on the dashboard.
It's accessible at <http://localhost:9000/>.
The credentials are `admin`/`admin` by default.

[.text-center]
image::dashboard-login.png[Dashboard login,437,579]

After logging, go to btn:[Route] in the navigation bar on the left side.
In the `Route` list, we can see the `Route` we created previously.

image::dashboard-routes-list.png[]

Next, navigate to btn:[Upstream].
Likewise, the dashboard displays our `Upstream`.

image::dashboard-upstreams-list.png[]

=== Update existing objects

The Dashboard allows not only viewing existing objects but also creating, updating and deleting object.
At the moment, neither the `Route` nor the `Upstream` have a user-friendly name.
We will use two different methods to add one:
via the _Configure_ wizard and directly via the JSON object.

==== Updating via the Configure wizard

. Go to the `Upstream` screen
. Click the btn:[Configure] button for the single `Upstream` displayed
. In the opening screen, set a name, _e.g._, "Local httpbin"
+
image::dashboard-upstream-details.png[]
. Click btn:[Next], then btn:[Submit].
The list now displays the `Upstream` with its updated name.
+
image:dashboard-upstreams-list-updated.png[]

==== Updating via JSON

As an alternative to the wizard, we can directly update an object's JSON configuration.

. Navigate to the `Route` screen
. On the right side of the `Route` object, locate the menu:More[View] button
+
image:dashboard-routes-list-view.png[]
. On the opening screen, change the name to something more descriptive, _e.g_, "Anything"
+
image:dashboard-route-details-raw.png[]
. In the list, we can now see the updated `Route` name
+
image:dashboard-routes-list-updated.png[]

This is but a taste of the Apache APISIX Dasboard.
We continue the workshop with the CLI.

== Learning about `Consumer` and `Plugin` via an authentication use case

The `Route` we have created above is public.
Thus, anyone can access the underlying `Upstream` as long as they know the endpoint Apache APISIX exposes to the outside world.
It's not safe, as a malicious actor could use this endpoint.
In this section, we are going to set up authentication for our requests to `httpbin`.

=== Create a `Consumer`

Authentication is tied to an _identity_; Apache APISIX represents an identity as a `Consumer` object.
With the help of the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/admin-api/#consumer[Admin API^], list all existing `Consumer` objects; there should be none.

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/4_list_consumers.sh[]
----
====

Now, let's create a `Consumer` object with the name `johndoe`.

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/5_create_consumer.sh[]
----
====

Now, list the `Consumer` objects again.
The result should be something like this (formatted for ease of reading):

[source,json]
----
{
  "list": [
    {
      "key": "/apisix/consumers/johndoe",
      "value": {
        "update_time": 1714465186,
        "create_time": 1714461458,
        "username": "johndoe"
      },
      "modifiedIndex": 58,
      "createdIndex": 38
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
----

=== Add a `Plugin` to a `Route` object

So far, we have used several APISIX abstractions: `Route`, `Upstream`, and `Consumer`.
We need one more to go further.
Apache APISIX builds upon a plugin-based architecture:
every functionality such as rate limiting, authentication, etc. is implemented via a `Plugin` object.
APISIX comes with a large set of https://apisix.apache.org/plugins/[built-in plugins^] for common capabilities, but you can create your own in case you can't find one that fits your requirements.

https://apisix.apache.org/plugins/#Authentication[A couple of existing plugins^] implement authentication.
To keep things simple, we are going to use the simplest one, the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/key-auth/[key-auth^] plugin.
With this plugin, we can authenticate requests based on either an HTTP header or a query parameter.
First, we need to add the `Plugin` to the `Route`.
Use the Admin API to enable the `key-auth` plugin for the `Route` we created earlier.

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/6_add_authentication_to_route.sh[]
----

<1> Use the `/routes` endpoints
<2> Work on the `Route` with ID `1`
<3> Patch the exising `Route`
<4> Set the `key-auth` plugin with no additional configuration
====

At this point, we control who can access the `/anything` endpoint by authenticating requests.
Requests that don't include a valid API key are rejected with an HTTP `401` status.
Let's check:

[source,bash]
----
curl -i localhost:9080/anything
----

Because we didn't set the authentication key, Apache APISIX will return a `401 Unauthorized` error.

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Tue, 30 Apr 2024 08:38:38 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Server: APISIX/3.9.0

{"message":"Missing API key found in request"}
----

To authenticate, we need to set the key on the `Consumer` object.
With the help of the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/admin-api/#consumer-api[Admin API^], update `johndoe` with an API key, _e.g._, `john`.

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/7_set_consumer_key.sh[]
----

<1> Use the `/consumers` endpoints
<2> The Consumers API doesn't support patching existing objects.
We need to use `PUT` *and* specify which `Consumer` object to work on
<3> Set the `key-auth` plugin with no additional configuration
====

We can now retry the same request with the authentication key.

[source,bash]
----
curl -H 'apikey: john' localhost:9080/anything           <1>
----

<1> The default header name is `apikey`.
You can override it in the `Plugin` configuration.

We can now successfully access the endpoint!

[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 334
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Tue, 30 Apr 2024 08:50:12 GMT
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Server: APISIX/3.9.0

{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Apikey": "john",
    "Host": "localhost:9080",
    "User-Agent": "curl/8.4.0",
    "X-Forwarded-Host": "localhost"
  },
  "json": null,
  "method": "GET",
  "origin": "192.168.65.1",
  "url": "http://localhost/anything"
}
----

In this section, we learned about the `Consumer` and `Plugin` objects, and how to implement a simple authentication mechanism with the `key-auth` plugin.

== Plugins Usage

=== JWT Plugin

Apache APISIX API Gateway acts as a single entry point and offers many authentication plugins, including:

* https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/basic-auth[HTTP Basic Auth^]
* https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/key-auth[API Keys based Auth^]
* https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/openid-connect[OpenID Connect^]
* https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/hmac-auth[HMAC Auth^]
* https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/ldap-auth[Ldap Authentication^]
* etc.

The https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/jwt-auth[JWT (JSON Web Token) plugin^] is another solid option for API gateway authentication.
JWT simplifies authentication setup, taking care of the nitty-gritty details.
Please refer to https://jwt.io/[JWT^] for more information.

[INFO]
====
The https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/jwt-auth[Apache APISIX JWT Plugin] acts as an issuer and also validates the token on behalf of the API.
It means that developers do not have to add any code to process the authentication.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
We need to disable the `key-auth` plugin we previously enabled to use another authentication plugin.
Disabling is possible via the Dashboard or the CLI.

image::disable-key-auth-plugin.png[]
====

Let's apply the JWT plugin to our existing API.
We update the existing `Consumer` plugin config with JWT-related configuration:

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/8_update_consumer_jwt_credentials.sh[]
----
====

The response will look something like this:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "node": {
    "key": "/apisix/consumers/example_consumer",
    "value": {
      "create_time": 1649158467,
      "username": "example_consumer",
      "update_time": 1649163154,
      "plugins": {
        "jwt-auth": {
          "base64_secret": false,
          "secret": "my-secret-key",
          "algorithm": "HS256",
          "key": "user-key",
          "exp": 86400
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "action": "set"
}
----

We can now add the `jwt-auth` plugin to the Route we have created previously:

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/8_add_jwt_plugin_to_route.sh[]
----
====

Response:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "node": {
    "key": "/apisix/routes/1",
    "value": {
      "upstream_id": "1",
      "uri": "/get",
      "create_time": 1648567195,
      "status": 1,
      "id": "1",
      "plugins": {
        "jwt-auth": {}
      },
      "priority": 0,
      "methods": [
        "GET"
      ],
      "update_time": 1649163340
    }
  },
  "action": "set"
}

----

==== Test Plugin

We want to validate that the setup is correct as we did before.

[TIP]
====
`jwt-auth` uses the HS256 algorithm by default.
If you use the RS256 algorithm, you must specify the algorithm and configure the public and private keys.
Please check the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/jwt-auth#:~:text=jwt%2Dauth%20uses%20the%20HS256%20algorithm[documentation^] for more details.
====

First, you need to set up the route for the API that signs the token, which will use the https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/public-api/[public-api^] plugin.

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/8_jwt_plugin_enable_public-api-plugin.sh[]
----
====

Response:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "action": "set",
  "node": {
    "key": "/apisix/routes/jas",
    "value": {
      "status": 1,
      "priority": 0,
      "id": "jas",
      "update_time": 1649490287,
      "plugins": {
        "public-api": {}
      },
      "uri": "/apisix/plugin/jwt/sign",
      "create_time": 1649490287
    }
  }
}
----

Then, run the following command to generate a new JWT token:

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/8_jwt_plugin_generate_token.sh[]
----
====

Apache APISIX returns a token:

[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 05 Apr 2022 12:57:34 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Server: APISIX/2.12.1

<GENERATED_TOKEN>
----

We can use the newly-generated token to authenticate our next request:

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/8_jwt_plugin_in_use.sh[]
----
====

Output with token:

[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 454
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Tue, 05 Apr 2022 13:02:30 GMT
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Server: APISIX/2.12.1
----

If you try to access the same endpoint without a token in the Header request, you will get HTTP Error _401 Unauthorized:

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/8_jwt_plugin_failure_example.sh[]
----
====

Output without token:

[source,json5]
----
{ "message": "Missing JWT token in request" }
----

We have validated the client's identity attempting to request by using various https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/key-auth[authentication plugins] with the help of Apache APISIX.

[TIP]
====
A https://youtu.be/kbELyQIXAsw[Centralized Authentication with Apache APISIX Plugins^] video tutorial describes different authentication methods, overviews the use-cases and benefits of centralized authentication with Apache APISIX API Gateway and you will learn how to configure common authentication plugins like basic, key, and JWT to protect your services.
====

=== Consumer Restriction Plugin

In our modern era, API security has become increasingly important.
Many hardening techniques are available:

* TLS encryption
* API Firewalls
* Validating request data
* Throttling for protection
* Continuously monitoring
* Auditing
* Logging
* IP restriction

An API Gateway can handle all those cross-cutting concerns.

[INFO]
====
One of the techniques is to make corresponding access restrictions to API resources for specific users or services.
https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/ip-restriction/[Consumer Restriction^] (_consumer-restriction_)
‚Äì makes corresponding
access restrictions to your services or routes based on different users selected.
If unknown user tries to send a request, Apache APISIX will meet them with an error.

====

Assume that we have two consumers of our APIs (`jack2019` and `jack2020`). We want to give an access only to one of them.
To do so, let's create two consumers and enable `consumer-restriction` plugin for our existing _Example route_.

To create the first consumer, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/consumers -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -i -d '
{
    "username": "jack1",
    "plugins": {
        "basic-auth": {
            "username":"jack2019",
            "password": "123456"
        }
    }
}'
----

To create the second consumer, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/consumers -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -i -d '
{
    "username": "jack2",
    "plugins": {
        "basic-auth": {
            "username":"jack2020",
            "password": "123456"
        }
    }
}'
----

Then, enable `consumer-restriction` plugin:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/get",
    "plugins": {
        "basic-auth": {},
        "consumer-restriction": {
            "whitelist": [
                "jack1"
            ]
        }
    },
    "upstream_id": "1"
}'
----

Output:

[source,json]
----
{
  "node": {
    "key": "\/apisix\/routes\/1",
    "value": {
      "status": 1,

          ],
          "rejected_code": 403,
          "type": "consumer_name"
        }
      },
      "uri": "\/get",
      "id": "1",
      "upstream_id": "1"
    }
  },
  "action": "set"
}
----

[TIP]
====

The `consumer-restriction` has the _type_ property which is enumerated type (it support the following values:
_consumer_name_, _service_id_ and _route_id_), we can specify it to allow access to correspond object.


By default, the plugin returns a generic `{"message":"The consumer_name is forbidden."}` if the object is not allowed.
It's possible to configure a more friendly message via the plugin attribute.
====

Now we can test if the consumer _jack1_ can request the API resource with the provided credentials.

[source,bash]
----
curl -u jack2019:123456 http://127.0.0.1:9080/get
----

Output:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Authorization": "Basic amFjazIwMTk6MTIzNDU2",
    "Host": "127.0.0.1",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.79.1",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-6288fe68-0b820d5c62c90f860e7266da",

  },
  "origin": "172.20.0.1, 85.253.33.40",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1/get"
}
----

Now we can try to request the same path with different consumer:

[source,bash]
----
curl -u jack2020:123456 http://127.0.0.1:9080/get
----

However, our the second consumer has no access.

Output:

[source,json]
----
{"message":"The consumer_name is forbidden."}
----

It is also possible to disable a plugin, we can delete the corresponding JSON configuration from the plugin configuration.
*Apache APISIX supports hot reloading*; there's no need to restart the service!

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '

=== Limit Count Plugin

API traffic management can improve the overall visibility of one's system and better understand the state of the traffic throughout one's organization.
A better understanding of the undergoing activities provides many opportunities to solve problems.

With the help of an API Gateway, one can set automatic retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, or rate-limiting.
Rate limiting is a strategy for limiting network traffic. It puts a cap on how often someone can repeat an action within a specific timeframe ‚Äì for instance, trying to log into an account.

[INFO]
====
The https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/limit-count/[Limit count plugin^] is one among many limiting plugins.
It limits the request rate by a fixed number of requests in a given time window:
how many HTTP requests one can make in a given period of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years.
====

Let's enable the `limit-count` plugin on our existing Route.
To do so, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/get",
    "plugins": {
        "limit-count": {
            "count": 2,
            "time_window": 60,
            "rejected_code": 503,
            "key_type": "var",
            "key": "remote_addr"
        }
    },
    "upstream_id": "1"
}'
----

Output:

----

The above configuration limits the number of requests to *two in 60 seconds*.
Apache APISIX will handle the first two requests as usual:

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/get
----

A third request in the same period will return a 503 HTTP code:

[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
Date: Sun, 08 May 2022 10:51:02 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

<body>
<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>
<hr><center>openresty</center>
</body>
</html>
----

You can configure the failure HTTP Status `403 Forbidden` by configuring `rejected_code` and message with the `rejected_msg` attributes.
For example, we can set it with `Requests are too frequent, please try again later`.
After reaching the threshold, the response is similar to the following:

=== HTTP Logger Plugin

API observability is the ability to understand system behavior and investigate the interactions between an application's components. It provides for your API tracers, metrics and loggers.

The core of API observability breaks down into three key areas: structured logs, metrics, and traces. Let‚Äôs break down each pillar and learn how with Apache APISIX Plugins we can simplify these tasks.

Logs are also easy to instrument and trivial step of API observability.
An API event is logged each time an API operation is invoked. You can gain analytic insights into your API activities or debug your APIs through the logged data

[INFO]
====
For instance, https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/http-logger/#how-to-enable[HTTP logger Plugin^]
pushes Log data requests to HTTP/HTTPS servers or sends as JSON objects to Monitoring tools.
====

The following is an example of how to enable the http-logger for our specific route.
You could generate a mock HTTP server at http://mockbin.org/bin/create[mockbin^] to view the logs.

To http-logger settings, we can just put our mock server uri address like below:

[source,json5]
----
{"uri": "http://mockbin.org/bin/5451b7cd-af27-41b8-8df1-282ffea13a61"}
----

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/9_http_logger_plugin_enable.sh[]
----
====

You will get the following response:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "node": {
    "value": {
      "update_time": 1648189729,
      "uri": "/get",

      "status": 1,
      "priority": 0,
      "upstream_id": "1",

      },
      "id": "1"
    },
    "key": "/apisix/routes/1"
  },
  "action": "set"
}

----

We can send a request to this get endpoint to generate logs.

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/get
----

Next, access your mock server logs and check logs

[source,http request]
----
https://mockbin.org/bin/5451b7cd-af27-41b8-8df1-282ffea13a61/log
----

As you can see, some recent logs are sent to our mock server:

=== Prometheus plugin

API monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing data about the performance of an API to identify problems that impact users. If an application is running slowly, you must first understand the cause before you can correct it.

Metrics are a numeric representation of data measured over intervals of time. You can also aggregate this data into daily or weekly frequency and run queries against a distributed system like Elasticsearch. Or sometimes based on metrics you trigger alerts to take any action later. Once API metrics are collected, you can track them with metrics tracking tools such as Prometheus.

[INFO]
====
https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/prometheus/[Prometheus plugin^]
can fetch API metrics data and you can show metrics exported by the plugin in https://grafana.com/[Grafana^].
====

Let's enable `prometheus` plugin for our route:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/get",
    "plugins": {
        "prometheus":{}
    },
    "upstream_id": "1"
}'
----

[NOTE]
====
When set _prefer_name_ to true in the request attribute, it will print route/service name instead of id in Prometheus metric.
====

Response:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "node": {
    "value": {
      "update_time": 1648206467,
      "uri": "/get",
      "create_time": 1646341656,
      "status": 1,
      "priority": 0,
      "plugins": {
        "prometheus": {
          "prefer_name": false
        }
      },
      "upstream_id": "1",
      "id": "1"
    },
    "key": "/apisix/routes/1"
  },
  "action": "set"
}
----

We fetch the metric data from the specified url `/apisix/prometheus/metrics`.

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9091/apisix/prometheus/metrics
----

You will get response with Prometheus metrics something like below:

...
----

And we can also check the status of our endpoint at Prometheus dashboard by pointing to this
URL `http://localhost:9090/targets`

image::prometheus-plugin-dashboard-screenshot.png[]

As you can see, Apache APISIX exposed metrics endpoint is upon and running.

Now you can query metrics for `apisix_http_status` to see what http requests are handled by API Gateway and what was outcome.

image::prometheus-plugin-dashboard-query-http-status-screenshot.png[]

image::prometheus-plugin-dashboard-query-http-status-table-screenshot.png[]

[NOTE]
====
Metrics exported by the plugin can be visualized in Grafana using a drop in https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11719[Apache APISIX Grafana Dashboard Template^]
====

In addition to this, you can view Grafana dashboard running in your local instance. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`

image::prometheus-plugin-grafana-dashboard-screenshot.png[]

Behind the scene, Apache APISIX downloads https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/docs/assets/other/json/apisix-grafana-dashboard.json[Grafana dashboard meta], imports it to Grafana and fetches real time metrics from Prometheus plugin.

=== Zipkin Plugin

The third observability pillar is a tracing or distributed tracing allows you to understand the life of a request as it traverses your service network allows you to answer questions like
what service has this request touched and how much latency was introduced.

Traces enable you to further explore which logs to look at for a particular session or related set of API calls.

[INFO]
====
https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin[Zipkin^] an open source distributed tracing system. https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/zipkin[APISIX Zipkin plugin^] is supported to collect tracing and report to Zipkin Collector based on https://zipkin.io/pages/instrumenting.html[Zipkin API specification^].
====

Here's an example to enable the `zipkin plugin` on the specified route:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/get",
    "plugins": {
        "zipkin": {
            "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:9411/api/v2/spans",
            "sample_ratio": 1
        }
    },
    "upstream_id": "1"
}'
----

Successful response looks like below:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "node": {
    "key": "/apisix/routes/1",
    "value": {
      "upstream_id": "1",
      "status": 1,
      "create_time": 1646341656,
      "uri": "/get",
      "methods": [
        "GET"
      ],
      "update_time": 1648558131,

        }
      },
      "priority": 0
    }
  },
  "action": "set"
}
----

We can test our example by simple running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/get
----

Response:
[source,json5]
----

----

As you can see, there are some additional trace identifiers (like traceId, spanId, parentId) were appended to the headers:

[source,text]
----
    "X-B3-Parentspanid": "61bd3f4046a800e7",

    "X-B3-Traceid": "e18985df47dab632d62083fd96626692",
----

Then you can use a browser to access http://127.0.0.1:9411/zipkin, see traces on the Web UI of Zipkin

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to run the Zipkin instance in order to install Zipkin Web UI.
For example, by using docker you can simply run it:

=== Serverless Plugin

Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. It provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications.

Apache APISIX provides support for serverless frameworks for popular cloud vendors such as https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/functions/[Azure Functions^]

[INFO]
====
https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/azure-functions[Azure Functions Serverless Plugin^] lets the users define an upstream to the Azure HTTP Trigger based Function with the combination of other request plugins to secure, manage Azure functions as a dynamic upstream to proxy all requests for a particular URI.
====

We are assuming your https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=in-process%2Cfunctionsv2&pivots=programming-language-csharp[HTTP Trigger Function^] is deployed in Azure and ready to be served.
Please, follow the tutorial to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal[create your first function in the Azure portal^]

image::azure-function-exists-screentshot.png[]

For the purpose of demo, the Function app is running on this address
`https://apisix-gateway.azurewebsites.net/`

[NOTE]
====
We need to only enable https://portal.azure.com/#@OnOffAppOU.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/178fbd72-9758-4f8e-84e5-8d0a0ffa0fcd/resourcegroups/apisix/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/apisix-gateway/functionsList[apisix-gateway^] HttpTrigger function from Azure Portal.
====

Let's run the following cmd to enable `azure-functions` plugin for the route:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '

            "authorization": {
                "apikey": "<Generated API key to access the Azure-Function>"
            }
        }
    },
    "uri": "/azure"

    }
  },
  "action": "set"
}

----

Now any requests (HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTP2) to URI `/azure` on the Apache APISIX gateway will trigger an HTTP based function For example ( here Azure Cloud Function just take the name query param and returns Hello $name):

[source,bash]

=== Plugin Orchestration

Sometimes your service requires you to use many plugins together or create custom plugins in addition to Apache Apisix provides. Plugin orchestration is a form of low-code that can help enterprises automate development.

[INFO]
====
With the plugin orchestration capability in the low-code API gateway Apache APISIX, we can easily orchestrate 50+ plugins in a ‚Äúdrag-and-drop‚Äù way.
====

In the Apache APISIX Dashboard's, Plugin config web interface lists the currently available plugins and drawing boards, and we can drag and drop the plugins onto the drawing boards to arrange them.

More about the Apache APISIX plugin orchestration you can read on this https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2021/07/27/use-of-plugin-orchestration-in-apache-apisix/[blog post^]
====

Let's think of new scenario where we decide the subsequent API request processing logic based on the processing result of previous plugin:

1. Our API receives requests only from whitelisted IPs with the `ip-restriction` plugin control.
2. If the IP is in the whitelist, `limit-count` takes over and limits
the number of requests 2 within 60 seconds time window.
3. If new request comes from different IP range, the plugin returns a 403 (requested resource is forbidden) HTTP status code.

After putting all building blocks to the drawing board (plugins, condition),
we will have a diagram similar to below:

image::plugin-orchestraion-new-scenario-screenshot.png[]

We need to also configure a rule for our condition like `code == 403` for negative case, if the request from unknown IP address. Double-click btn:[Condition] and new _Configure Rule_
pop-up menu appears.

image::plugin-orchestration-configure-rule-screenshot.png[]

You can fill in `ip-restriction` plugin config the following details in the Plugin Editor. Double-click on btn:[ip-restriction], apply config and click btn:[Submit].

image::plugin-orchestration-configure-ip-restriction-config-screenshot.png[]

Similarly to `limit-count`:

Finally, click btn:[Next] and btn:[Submit] the changes applied on the route.

=== Plugin Development

During technological selection in a project implementation, the most important consideration for the development team is whether the chosen product matches the team‚Äôs technology stack or not. Apache APISIX has been supporting customized plugins since the day it was born.

A plugin is an important mechanism in APISIX API Gateway by using it, we can create high-performance systems under tight deadlines. With Apache APISIX we can write custom plugins in a programming language we are familiar with, including Lua, Python, Java, Go, PHP and more.

[INFO]
====
In this demo, we will see simple example of a plugin development in Lua.
For other languages, please review the documentation on https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/external-plugin/[External Plugins^]
====

Let's create new file-logger custom plugin. Users can use the file-logger plug-in to append JSON-formatted request and response data to log files, or push the Log data stream to a specified location given in the path.

Below the whole process of new plugin creation:

* *Step 1.* Go to `/apisix-config` folder to modify `config.yaml`
* *Step 2.* Setup `extra_lua_path` path to load our own plugin code. Add below line to
under `apisix:` section in the config file:

[source,yaml]
----
apisix:
 ...
 extra_lua_path: "/opt/?.lua"
----

[NOTE]
====
Please note if there is another existing plugin with the same name, new custom plugin code will be loaded instead of the built-in one, and you can use this way to override the builtin behavior if needed.
====

* *Step 3.* In the same `config.yaml` file under `plugins` section, you can see all enabled plugins specified by their names:

[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - http-logger
  - ip-restriction
  - jwt-auth
  - key-auth
  - limit-conn
  - limit-count
  .....
  - file-logger // To enable our custom plugin, we add the plugin name to the end of list.

----

* *Step 4.* Next we create the `file-logger.lua` file in the apisix-workshop/file-logger-plugin/src directory
and write a code to print as an output the plug-in configuration data and request-related data information to the APISIX `error.log` file. You can use the following code to log:

[source,lua]
----
core.log.warn(core.json.encode(conf))
core.log.warn("ctx: ", core.json.encode(ctx, true))
----

The source code is located in `custom-plugin` folder in the project.

.See the `file-logger.lua` plugin source code

[source,text]
----
local core         =   require("apisix.core") <1>

local plugin_name = "file-logger" <2>

local schema = { <3>
    type = "object",
    properties = {
        path = {
            type = "string"
        },
    },
    required = {"path"}
}


local _M = { <4>
    version = 1.0,
    priority = 100,
    name = plugin_name,
    schema = schema,
}

function _M.check_schema(conf) <5>
    local ok, err = core.schema.check(schema, conf)
    if not ok then
        return false, err
    end

    return true
end

function _M.log(conf, ctx) <6>
    core.log.warn("conf: ", core.json.encode(conf))
    core.log.warn("ctx: ", core.json.encode(ctx, true))
end


return _M

----
<1> Import apisix core library to reuse built-in methods for the plugin schema validation, printing logs and encoding the input to JSON format.
<2> Set a name of new custom plugin and later we pass the name to plugin config field.
<3> Define plugin properties, in our case we have single required param _path_ where we command to plugin to create a log file in the given path.
<4> _M is very important field in APISIX plugin development which affect the plugin's behavior. There, we can assign plugin version, name, priority, schema and other metadata information.
<5> We override and implement the check_schema(conf) method to complete the plugin specification verification. Core library has provided the public method "core.schema.check", which can be used directly to complete JSON verification as well.
We can also write our custom logic to validate the schema.
<6> The code section shows how to implement any logic relevant to the plugin in the log phase and print some logs. Here, the _conf_ parameter is the relevant configuration information of the plugin, you can use _core.log.warn(core.json.encode(conf))_ to output it to _error.log_ for viewing. And the _ctx_ parameter caches data information related to the request. You can use _core.log.warn(core.json.encode(ctx, true))_ to output it to _error.log_ for viewing

IMPORTANT: Before you introduce new plugin, always determine firstly its name and priority of the plugin. The priority of the new plugin cannot be same to any existing ones.
Plugins with higher priority value will be executed first in a given phase.

====

* *Step 5.* In the project root, open `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following volume info to mount `files-logger` plugin source code to docker:

[source,yaml]
----
volumes:
  - ./apisix_log:/usr/local/apisix/logs
  - ./apisix_conf/config.yaml:/usr/local/apisix/conf/config.yaml:ro
  - ./file-logger-plugin/src:/opt/apisix/plugins:ro
----

* *Step 6.* Enable the plugin for the route and test.

Up to now, we have already prepared `example_upstream` locally.
We can setup new route with our new plugin enabled.

.See the command
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::{commandsdir}/14_custom_file_logger_plugin_enable.sh[]
----
====

Then you will see a status code of 200 with the response, indicating that the route has been successfully created.

.See the response

[source,json5]
----
{
  "action": "set",
  "node": {
    "value": {
      "upstream_id": "1",
      "uri": "/get",
      "priority": 0,
      "plugins": {
        "file-logger": {
          "path": "logs/file.log"
        }
      },
      "update_time": 1649529440,
      "status": 1,
      "methods": [
        "GET"
      ],
      "create_time": 1648567195,
      "id": "1"
    },
    "key": "/apisix/routes/1"
  }
}
----
====

In the `apisix_log/error.log` file there will be a record likely below in JSON format:

[source,text]
----
ctx: {"conf_type":"route","conf_version":21998,"conf_id"
.....
conf: {"path":"logs\/file.log"} while logging request
.....
----

It can be seen that the path: `logs/file.log` we configured for the plugin as the conf parameter has been successfully saved. So far we have successfully created a minimal usable plugin that prints the data for the conf and ctx parameters in the log phase.

[TIP]
====
We can directly run `apisix reload` command to reload the latest plugin code without restarting Apache APISIX.
====

.See the command to reload the new added plugin:
[%collapsible]
====
[source,curl]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/plugins/reload -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT
----
====

You can also try to write core functionality for the custom `file-logger` plugin,
where the program can get the log output path from conf param, create/update the file with new logs.
Please refer to https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugin-develop/[Apache APISIX Plug-in Development Guide^] and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/lua_file_io.htm[Lua's IO library^] to learn how to implement it.

=== Just enough abstractions

We should first familiarize ourselves with a couple of core concepts offeres by APISIX.

* https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/architecture-design/upstream/[Upstream^] represents a backend service from the Apache APISIX point of view.
* https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/architecture-design/route/[Route^] is the most important concept; it instructs APISIX to forward traffic to the correct upstream based on the request.
* APISIX is build on top of a plugin architecture.
Every feature (authentication, authorization, etc.) is a https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/architecture-design/plugin/[Plugin^].
For reference purposes, plugins are grouped into categories: general, transformation, authentication, security, traffic control, observability, serverless, and other protocols.
